Using Vagrant on OSX
====================

When installing vagrant you may run into some issues when installing
vagrant and veewee. In order to avoid these issuses, I recommend to
install on OSX first rvm. Another good program for OSX to deal with different Ruby versions is JewleryBox.

Once that is acomplished I recommend to just use

  gem install veewee

as this will install the proper version of vagrant on your machine.

I also noticed that for some reason I have difficulties with the GUI
setup once Virtual box starts. It selects a language I do not
want. Apparently when you switch of the GUI in the Vagrant file, this
seems to solve this issue, however you can than just go with the
defaults.

As I do not want to inteact anyways via a GUI thisis te bes solution.
